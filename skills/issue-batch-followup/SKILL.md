# Issue Batch Followup

Continue one `issue-batch-sdd` issue after `DONE_FOR_HUMAN_REVIEW`: read the issue artifacts, handle human review feedback on the existing issue branch, update the artifacts, and create a GitHub or Gitee pull request only after explicit human approval.

## Scope

Use this skill for a single issue branch that came from `issue-batch-sdd`.

Do not use this skill for:

- starting a new issue batch
- implementing unrelated issues
- opening pull requests for branches not produced by `issue-batch-sdd`
- platforms other than GitHub or Gitee

**Required background:** This skill reuses `issue-batch-sdd`'s artifact layout, branch rules, artifact-commit rules, and the canonical status lifecycle — see that skill for definitions. The handoff point is `DONE_FOR_HUMAN_REVIEW`.

## Core Rules

- Handle exactly one issue at a time.
- Work on the existing issue branch. Do not create a new followup branch unless the human explicitly asks.
- Treat human feedback as authoritative but keep it inside the selected issue scope.
- Do not commit `.agents/issue-sdd/` artifacts; artifact content may only be summarized or copied into the pull request description.
- Do not create a pull request until the human explicitly approves the issue or asks to open the PR/MR (see [Human Approval Gate](#human-approval-gate)).
- Remote issue and PR operations are supported only on GitHub and Gitee: use `gh` CLI for GitHub and the Gitee MCP tools for Gitee.

## Inputs

Find the issue from one or more user-provided hints:

- issue id or title
- issue artifact path
- branch name
- batch directory
- remote issue URL

Resolve in this order:

1. Match the hints against `.agents/issue-sdd/*/progress.md` (the Status table carries a `Branch` column). If exactly one issue matches, use it.
2. If no hint matches, use the current branch name as the input and resolve it against `progress.md`.
3. If multiple candidates match and the current branch cannot disambiguate, ask the human to confirm the branch or batch directory before proceeding.

To list candidate issues, prefer running the listing script instead of reading each `progress.md`:

```bash
bash skills/issue-batch-followup/scripts/list-issues.sh
```

Prints `<batch>\t<progress row>` for each issue row that has a branch, to help identify the target issue.

## Artifact Contract

The artifact layout is defined by `issue-batch-sdd` (see its Batch Artifacts section); this skill does not redefine it.

Read the useful files for the selected issue before changing code, especially the issue directory's `brief.md`, `implementer-report.md`, `reviewer-report.md`, and `decision-needed.md` if present.

This skill additionally creates/updates two files in the issue directory, kept concise and factual:

- `followup-report.md` — create/update during this skill
- `pr-body.md` — create/update before PR/MR creation

### `followup-report.md`

```text
# Followup Report

## Human Feedback

- <date/time>: <human feedback or approval>

## Scope Assessment

- In scope: <yes/no>
- Reason: <why>
- Decision needed: <yes/no and what>

## Followup Changes

- <what changed>

### Files Touched

- <path>

### Verification

- `<command>`: pass | fail | not run

### Remaining Risk

- <risk or "None known">

## Approval

- Status: pending | changes-requested | approved
- Approved by: <human name or "user">
- Approval note: <exact approval request or summary>
```

### `pr-body.md`

Use this file as the source for the PR/MR body. It is the public version of the artifacts.

```text
## Issue

<remote issue reference if available>

## Summary

- <implementation summary>

## Verification

- `<command>`: <result>

## Risks

- <risk or "None known">
```

Do not paste private scratch notes, chain-of-thought, unrelated logs, or raw `.agents` file dumps into the PR body.

## Workflow

1. **Identify one issue.** Confirm the issue id/title, branch, and artifact directory.
2. **Check status, then switch to the issue branch.** Do not overwrite unrelated user changes.
3. **Read artifacts.** Read the issue brief, implementation report, reviewer report, decision note if present, and relevant batch files.
4. **Classify the human feedback** and note it in `followup-report.md`:
   - If in scope and actionable, implement it.
   - If unclear, ask one focused question.
   - If it changes product behavior, permissions, storage, schema, audit semantics, or issue scope, ask the human for confirmation.
   - If it is a new issue, recommend creating a separate issue instead of expanding this branch.
   - If it is an approval, go to step 8.
5. **Make requested changes.** Use the repo's normal development and test practices.
6. **Verify.** Run the smallest relevant checks that prove the followup. Broaden verification if shared behavior changed.
7. **Wait for approval.** If the human has not approved, report that the branch is ready for another human review.
8. **Commit code changes when appropriate.** Commit only intended repository changes; keep `.agents/issue-sdd/` uncommitted.
9. **Update artifacts.** Update `followup-report.md` and `progress.md`.
10. **Prepare PR/MR body.** Write `pr-body.md` from the public artifact summary.
11. **Create PR/MR only after explicit approval.** Push the issue branch if needed, then use the platform-specific path below.

## Status Updates

The canonical status lifecycle is defined by `issue-batch-sdd` (see its Statuses section); this skill does not redefine it. It transitions the selected issue through the post-review statuses: `HUMAN_CHANGES_REQUESTED`, `FOLLOWUP_IN_PROGRESS`, `APPROVED_BY_HUMAN`, `PR_OPENED`, or `FOLLOWUP_BLOCKED`.

Update the selected issue row in `progress.md` when useful, and append a timestamped ledger entry for each meaningful transition.

## Git Operation Contract

Before committing or pushing:

- inspect the worktree status
- stage only intended repository files
- leave `.agents/issue-sdd/` unstaged
- do not delete or rewrite human changes unrelated to the issue
- use the existing repository commit style if one is obvious

Before PR/MR creation:

- ensure the issue branch has the intended commits
- push the issue branch to the matching GitHub or Gitee remote if it is not already pushed
- confirm the PR/MR body comes from `pr-body.md`, not from raw artifact dumps

### GitHub Path

Use this path when the target repository remote is GitHub.

1. Inspect remotes and branch.
2. Determine the base branch from `triage.md`, the current branch's upstream, or the repository default from `gh repo view`.
3. Determine issue association:
   - If the source issue is in the same GitHub repository, include `Refs #<number>` in `pr-body.md`.
   - If the human explicitly wants auto-close behavior, use `Closes #<number>` or `Fixes #<number>`.
4. Create the PR:

```bash
gh pr create --base <base-branch> --head <issue-branch> --title "<title>" --body-file <path-to-pr-body.md>
```

If `gh` is not authenticated or the repository is not on GitHub, stop and report the blocker.

### Gitee Path

Use this path when the target repository remote is Gitee.

1. Identify `owner`, `repo`, current branch, target base branch, and issue number if available.
2. Use the Gitee MCP `create_pull` tool (service `mcp_gitee`), not raw HTTP calls.
3. Set:
   - `owner`: repository owner path
   - `repo`: repository path
   - `base`: target branch
   - `head`: issue branch, or `namespace:branch` if needed
   - `title`: concise issue title
   - `body`: contents of `pr-body.md`
   - `issue`: source issue number when the source is a Gitee issue and the MCP field applies

Also include the issue reference in the body so the association remains visible even if platform linking behavior differs.

### Unknown Platform

If the repository platform cannot be identified as GitHub or Gitee, stop and ask the human what to do.

## Human Approval Gate

Explicit approval examples:

- "approved, open the PR"
- "looks good, create the MR"
- "审核通过，帮我提 PR"
- "可以提交到 Gitee"

Not approval:

- "run tests"
- "looks closer"
- "fix this last thing"
- "what would the PR say?"

When in doubt, ask before creating the PR/MR.

## Red Flags

Stop and ask for human direction if:

- multiple issue artifact directories match
- the current branch does not match the selected issue
- there are unrelated uncommitted changes
- human feedback expands beyond the issue brief
- followup requires schema, permission, audit, migration, or storage changes not already specified
- verification cannot run for environmental reasons
- the remote is not GitHub or Gitee
- platform auth is missing
- the human asks to commit `.agents/issue-sdd/`

## Summary

When PR/MR is created, report:

- PR/MR URL or number
- linked issue reference
- verification summary
- any residual risk
